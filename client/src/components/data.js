    text: `In short, a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you’ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.

Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.

This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.

The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.

Let’s start your blog!

Step 1: Pick a blog name
If you are not sure what to name your blog, or what topic to blog about, skip to the next section.

If you’ve already got an idea for the name of your blog, you can check to make sure that no one else has already registered it:

See if your blog name is available:
 Enter blog name & extension here...

 
Note: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.

If you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:

Try a different domain extension. If the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of the name.

Add small words. Words like “a”, “my”, “best”, or “the”. For example, this site is called TheBlogStarter.com instead of BlogStarter.com.
Add dashes between words. For example, scott-chow.com
How to Choose a Blog Topic & Name
If you don’t have an idea for a name already, the first step is choosing your blog topic.

If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are a few ways to find a good blog topic:

Life experiences. Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations.
For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.
Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).
A personal blog. A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.
Hobbies & passions. Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.
Once you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.

A good blog name should be descriptive so that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name. `,

    text: `While protecting your privacy online has been a subject of interest for a while now, events in the news — for example, the chat history Facebook recently turned over to police — have brought it front and center. But how do you protect your privacy while staying in touch with friends and relatives? While there are a number of messaging apps that boast increased privacy features, sometimes you can’t persuade the people you want to keep in touch with to use them. What is your alternative? What, for example, if they insist on chatting with Facebook Messenger?

Well, you can start by using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Messenger.


AD
Basically, end-to-end encryption means that nobody — even Facebook’s company Meta — should be able to read what is in your chat. In short, this is accomplished by each party’s account being assigned a special key; only the account with that key can unlock the message. Currently, Meta has E2EE available on its Messenger platform but only on a per-chat basis. The company has announced its intention to turn on E2EE by default soon, but in the meantime, if you’re about to embark on a Messenger conversation that you want to keep private, here’s how to turn it on. (The process is generally the same for both Android devices and iPhones.)

BEGIN AN ENCRYPTED CHAT
In your Messenger mobile app, select Chats in the bottom menu.
Tap on the Edit icon in the upper right (it looks like a pen).
Toggle on the lock icon in the top right.
Select the name of the person you want to chat with. (Note: according to Meta, there are some accounts you can’t use with E2EE, such as businesses and accounts of public figures.)
New encrypted message
The lock toggle on top indicates this is an encrypted conversation.
 
Information page in Messenger
You can also enable E2EE in the info page by tapping on Go to secret conversation.
If you’re already chatting with the person and decide you want to enable E2EE, you can do that as well.

Within the conversation, tap the information (looks like an “i”) icon in the top right.
Tap Go to secret conversation.
VANISH MODE AND DISAPPEARING CONVERSATIONS
From that information page, you can also go into Vanish mode, which will cause the conversation to vanish when you close the chat.

In the information page, tap Vanish mode.
Toggle Vanish mode on.
You can also decide at what time a message will vanish — anywhere from five seconds to a day. This is called a disappearing (rather than a vanishing) message. To create one:

Tap on the name of the person you’re texting with when you’re in the encrypted conversation.
You’ll be brought to the settings page for secret conversations. Tap on Disappearing messages.
Tap on the time limit you want.
Setup page for encrypted chat
In the chat, tap on the person’s name to access this setup page.
 
Disappearing messages page
In Disappearing messages, you can decide how long the message should last.
One thing to be aware of is that an encrypted conversation can only be between the people in that conversation and the devices they are using. If you start an encrypted conversation on one mobile device, you can’t just move to another device and continue it; you have to sign in to the Messenger app on the other device and manually add it to the conversation. (The other participants will be notified that there was a new device added.)`,
